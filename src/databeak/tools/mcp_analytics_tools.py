            1. **Start Here**: Always begin data work with get_data_summary()
            2. **Plan Operations**: Use shape/columns info to plan transformations
            3. **Drill Down**: Use preview data to identify specific rows/cells for get_cell_value()
            4. **Quality Check**: Use missing_data analysis to plan null handling
            5. **Next Steps**: Use coordinate_system info for precise operations
