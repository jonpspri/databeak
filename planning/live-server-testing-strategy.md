# Live FastMCP Server Testing Strategy for DataBeak

## Executive Summary

This document defines a comprehensive testing strategy for validating DataBeak's
FastMCP server through live server integration tests. The strategy bridges the
gap between unit testing and production deployment by ensuring MCP protocol
compliance and real-world operational correctness.

## Current Testing State Analysis

### Existing Test Infrastructure

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive unit/integration tests covering all 40+ MCP tools
- High test coverage (80%+ requirement) with pytest framework
- Async testing support via pytest-asyncio
- Good CI/CD integration with quality gates
- Functional integration tests validating tool workflows

**Current Test Approach:**

- Direct function call testing via in-memory session management
- Tool functionality validation through DataBeak's internal APIs
- Schema and data validation testing
- Error handling and edge case coverage

### Identified Gaps

**Missing Coverage:**

- Live MCP protocol interactions between client and server
- Transport layer validation (stdio, HTTP, SSE)
- Server startup/shutdown lifecycle testing
- MCP specification compliance verification
- End-to-end workflows through actual protocol communication
- Performance characteristics under realistic conditions

## Live Server Testing Architecture

### Core Testing Components

#### 1. Live Server Test Harness

```python
# Server lifecycle management
class LiveServerManager:
    - Start/stop FastMCP server in background processes
    - Manage different transport protocols
    - Handle server health checks and readiness
    - Clean resource management and teardown
```

#### 2. MCP Client Test Framework

```python
# Protocol interaction testing
class MCPClientTestHarness:
    - FastMCP Client integration for protocol testing
    - Transport-specific client configurations
    - Protocol message validation
    - Response parsing and verification
```

#### 3. Test Infrastructure Tools

**Required Dependencies:**

- `pytest-asyncio` (existing) - async test execution
- `httpx` (existing) - HTTP transport testing
- `psutil` - process management for server lifecycle
- `pytest-timeout` - prevent test hangs
- `pytest-benchmark` (existing) - performance validation

## Test Implementation Strategy

### 1. Server Lifecycle Testing

**Objectives:**

- Validate clean server startup across all transport modes
- Test graceful shutdown and resource cleanup
- Verify error handling during startup failures
- Validate configuration parameter processing

**Key Test Cases:**

- Server starts successfully with default configuration
- Server handles invalid configuration gracefully
- Clean shutdown preserves data integrity
- Resource cleanup prevents memory leaks

### 2. Transport Protocol Validation

**Stdio Transport:**

- Process communication through stdin/stdout
- Message framing and parsing
- Error propagation through stdio channels

**HTTP Transport:**

- RESTful API endpoint accessibility
- HTTP status code correctness
- Content-Type and response format validation
- Error response structure compliance

**SSE Transport:**

- Server-sent events streaming functionality
- Connection lifecycle management
- Event format and delivery verification

### 3. MCP Specification Compliance

**Protocol Requirements:**

- Tool discovery and enumeration
- Tool schema validation and parameter handling
- Resource listing and access patterns
- Prompt template functionality
- Error response format compliance

**Validation Approach:**

```python
async def test_mcp_tool_discovery():
    async with LiveServerManager() as server:
        async with MCPClient(server.connection) as client:
            tools = await client.list_tools()
            assert len(tools) >= 40  # DataBeak's tool count
            validate_tool_schemas(tools)
```

### 4. End-to-End Workflow Testing

**Complete CSV Analysis Pipeline:**

1. Load CSV data via MCP protocol
1. Perform transformations through tool calls
1. Execute analytics operations
1. Export results via resource endpoints
1. Validate session state consistency

**Multi-Session Management:**

- Concurrent session creation and management
- Session isolation verification
- Resource cleanup across sessions

### 5. Performance and Reliability Testing

**Performance Benchmarks:**

- Tool call response times
- Resource access latency
- Memory usage during long-running sessions
- Concurrent connection handling

**Reliability Validation:**

- Error recovery mechanisms
- Connection failure handling
- Server stability under load

## Development Lifecycle Integration

### Local Development

**Quick Smoke Tests (`uv run test-live-quick`):**

- Server startup validation
- Basic tool call functionality
- ~30 seconds execution time
- Run during active development

**Full Live Testing (`uv run test-live-full`):**

- Complete protocol compliance suite
- Performance benchmarks
- ~2-3 minutes execution time
- Run before commits

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**Pre-Commit Hooks:**

- Fast live server smoke tests
- Integration with existing quality gates

**CI Pipeline Structure:**

```yaml
test-live-server:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    matrix:
      transport: [stdio, http, sse]
      python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Setup Python and uv
    - name: Install dependencies
    - name: Run live server tests
      run: uv run test-live --transport=${{ matrix.transport }}
