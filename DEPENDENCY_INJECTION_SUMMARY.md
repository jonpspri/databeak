# DataBeak Dependency Injection Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented dependency injection patterns to address module
coupling issues, significantly improving testability and maintainability while
preserving backward compatibility.

## Problem Addressed

**Original Issue**: "Module Coupling: Some server modules may be tightly coupled
to session management. Consider dependency injection patterns to improve
testability."

### Before (Tight Coupling)

- Server functions directly imported and called `get_session_manager()`
- Hard to test business logic in isolation
- Session state was global and shared
- Difficult to mock or control for testing
- Repeated session validation code across all servers

### After (Dependency Injection)

- Services receive session manager as constructor parameter
- Easy to test with mock session managers
- Session management is injected, not hardcoded
- Clean separation between business logic and infrastructure
- Centralized session validation logic

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Abstractions Created

**`SessionManagerProtocol`** (`src/databeak/models/session_service.py`)

- Protocol defining session manager interface
- Enables dependency injection without tight coupling

**`SessionService`** (Abstract Base Class)

- Foundation for all business logic services
- Provides common session validation and error handling
- Takes session manager as constructor parameter

**`SessionServiceFactory`**

- Factory pattern for creating services with injected dependencies
- Manages dependency wiring

### 2. Service Implementation

**`StatisticsService`** (`src/databeak/services/statistics_service.py`)

- Implements all statistical operations with dependency injection
- Inherits from `SessionService` for common functionality
- Contains pure business logic without infrastructure concerns

### 3. Mock Infrastructure

**`MockSessionManager`**

- In-memory implementation for testing
- No dependencies on global session management
- Enables complete isolation of business logic tests

### 4. Backward Compatibility

**Updated Server Layer** (`src/databeak/servers/statistics_server.py`)

- Maintains existing FastMCP server interface
- Delegates to service layer with injected dependencies
- Zero breaking changes to existing API

### 5. Separated Response Models

**`statistics_models.py`**

- Moved Pydantic models to dedicated module
- Eliminates circular import issues
- Shared between servers and services

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Testability

```python
def test_statistics_calculation():
    # Create isolated test environment
    mock_manager = MockSessionManager()
    service = StatisticsService(mock_manager)

    # Add test data
    test_data = pd.DataFrame({'values': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})
    mock_manager.add_test_data("test", test_data)

    # Test business logic directly
    result = await service.get_statistics("test")
    assert result.statistics['values'].mean == 3.0
```

### ✅ Isolation

- Multiple services don't interfere with each other
- Each test gets its own mock session manager
- No shared global state between tests

### ✅ Flexibility

- Easy to inject different session management implementations
- Services can be configured with different behaviors
- Supports future extensibility (e.g., distributed sessions)

### ✅ Maintainability

- Clear separation between business logic and infrastructure
- Centralized session handling logic
- Easier to understand and modify business rules

### ✅ Backwards Compatibility

- Existing server functions still work unchanged
- No breaking changes to FastMCP integration
- Gradual migration path for other servers

## Testing Improvements

### Old Approach

- Tests required full session management infrastructure setup
- Global state could cause test interference
- Complex mocking of global functions required
- Hard to isolate business logic from infrastructure

### New Approach

- Create `MockSessionManager` for each test
- Inject mock into service via constructor
- Test business logic in complete isolation
- No global state or complex setup required

**Results**: 15 comprehensive tests pass, demonstrating:

- Service isolation
- Error handling
- Multiple independent services
- Mock session manager behavior

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `src/databeak/models/session_service.py` - Core DI abstractions
- `src/databeak/services/__init__.py` - Services package
- `src/databeak/services/statistics_service.py` - Statistics business logic
- `src/databeak/models/statistics_models.py` - Response models
- `tests/unit/services/test_statistics_service_dependency_injection.py` - DI
  tests
- `examples/dependency_injection_demo.py` - Working demonstration

### Modified Files

- `src/databeak/servers/statistics_server.py` - Updated to use services
- `src/databeak/models/__init__.py` - Added DI exports

## Demonstration Results

The live demo successfully showed:

- ✅ Service creation with mock session manager
- ✅ Statistical analysis (mean: 152.86, correlation: 0.998)
- ✅ Column-specific analysis (profit mean: 30.57)
- ✅ Value distribution analysis (Product A: 3 sales, B: 2, C: 2)
- ✅ Multiple independent services working simultaneously
- ✅ Proper error handling for invalid sessions/columns

## Next Steps

This implementation provides a solid foundation for:

1. **Extending to Other Servers**: Apply same pattern to discovery, validation,
   and IO servers
1. **Advanced Testing**: Property-based testing, performance testing with mocks
1. **Configuration Injection**: Inject configuration alongside session
   management
1. **Distributed Sessions**: Easy to swap in distributed session managers
1. **Monitoring**: Inject logging and metrics collection

## Conclusion

The dependency injection implementation successfully addresses the module
coupling concern while providing substantial improvements to testability,
maintainability, and code organization. The solution maintains full backward
compatibility and provides a clear migration path for future enhancements.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed tightly-coupled server modules into testable,
maintainable services with clean separation of concerns while preserving all
existing functionality.
